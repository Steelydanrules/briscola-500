      <h2>RULES (please read if you've never played!):</h2>
      <p>
      This is a two-team game, your partner is the one sitting directly across from you. Each player is
      dealt 5 cards (there are 4 suits: denari (yellow gold/coins), spade (blue swords), coppe (red cups), bastoni (green
      bats)). The point of the game is to keep on playing until 1 team gets 500 points.
      <br>
      <br>
      
      A card is thrown by the lead player; the only way for a team to win the hand is for the to throw a higher point value
      card of the SAME suit, or any card of the called BRISCOLA suit. The rounds are initialized with <b>no</b> BRISCOLA suit (unlike
      the conventional form of the game). The only way for a BRISCOLA to come into effect is one player has to have the King &
      Queen of the same suit in their hand and show it to the rest of the players in the game on their own turn.  You will see a 
      prompt on the right-hand side of the game when a BRISCOLA is available. Your team is
      also granted 40 points when you call a BRISCOLA. Any subsequent BRISCOLA call grants your team 20 points but does not change the current BRISCOLA
      suit.
      <br>
      <br>
      
      Calling a BRISCOLA means that the suit shown is now the "trump" suit. For instance: if a BRISCOLA of denari is called,
      and one leads with an ace of coppes, a two of denari will win the hand if it's thrown on top. The only cards that can beat
      a BRISCOLA are higher cards of the same suit. If the deck is empty and a BRISCOLA is in effect, teammates can show one
      another their cards at the beginning of one's turn (you will have the option to "view partner's hand"). Once all cards are thrown/collected, the points are counted and the
      deck is re-dealt. Point values & rankings are as follows (I am using Gold as an example); point values are on the bottom, 
      and a card on the right will beat a card on the right (barring there is no brisc suit):
